## Our Wonderful Story

1. Once upon a time, the scientist made a time machine and after he succeeded, someone who stole his time machine teleported to the castle.

2. Then suddenly, a dragon appeared…

4. After that, everyone got lost (or maybe teleported?) and somehow there was a **treasure chest**…

5. Someone found a map, but it had no directions.  
   (TODO: add an image of the map?)

6. “Let’s go to space!” shouted the pirate (although there was no pirate before this).  

7. A rocket blasted off, but at the same time the **time machine** broke down. 

8. The cat was supposed to talk here, but the line is missing.  

9. In the forest, the detective discovered… something.  
   (What did they find?)  

10. The ending… well, we don’t really have one. Please fix this.
